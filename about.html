                    <div class="container-right">
                        <p>Welcome to our KM coterie! My name is Kristelle and I can absolutely attest that #mumlife
                            with 2
                            little ones is utter chaos. But I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
                        <p>I am lucky enough to have a pigeon pair: my sassy toddler, Madeline, who keeps me on my toes,
                            and
                            my happy-go-lucky baby boy, Harvey.</p>
                        <p>Hands down, matrescence has been the most transformative period of my life. Every day is
                            rewarding, lonely, eye-opening, frustrating, exhausting and blissful all at once.</p>
                        <p>And I’ll let you in on a secret: 10+ years studying at university was no match for
                            motherhood.
                        </p>
                        <p>That being said, my law and business management degrees did help build the foundations of
                            Keeping
                            Mum.</p>
                        <p>And my fitness qualifications and background as a personal trainer and class instructor came
                            in
                            handy for Kangatraining!</p>
                        <p>Plus, my graduate degree in psychology allows me to support the emotional health of each
                            person
                            in our programs.</p>
                        <p>What’s more, thanks to motherhood, I now have an opportunity to bring mums (and their growing
                            tribe) together.</p>
                        <p>That’s why I truly believe all of life’s big choices and experiences are meant to lead us
                            somewhere spectacular.</p>
                        <p>
                            Keeping Mum happy, strong and connected is literally my dream job and I can’t wait to meet
                            every
                            single one of you!

                    <img src="./images/jennifer_conroy.jpg" alt="">
                    <div class="container-left">
                        <p>Hello to our amazing mumma community!</p>
                        <p>My name is Jen and I come with my two little ladies in tow. The sometimes Miss
                            Independent/sometimes super clingy, Isla and my happy girl, Grace, who has the most
                            infectious
                            smile.</p>
                        <p>As I am sure a lot of mums would say, having children has been the biggest learning curve I
                            have
                            ever had. Despite having been a qualified early childhood teacher for nearly a decade in my
                            previous life, I don't think anything can quite prepare you for the rollercoaster ride of
                            having
                            your own. There is no clocking off when you become a mum!</p>
                        <p>'It takes a village to raise a child' may sound cliché, but having both my children in a
                            pandemic, all my family overseas and few friends close by who had children, made me acutely
                            aware that I needed to create my own support network. This was an absolute necessity, not
                            only
                            for the help to make it through the really challenging days, but to make like-minded friends
                            that I could rely on to fully comprehend and accept this new version of me.</p>
                        <p>Meeting Kristelle and many other gorgeous mums through a mother's group was life changing for
                            me,
                            and the catalyst that sparked Keeping Mum. My early childhood teaching experience drives
                            many of
                            the values that underpin what we provide for the children during our mother’s group sessions
                            and
                            my fitness qualifications and experience as a gym manager allows me to support mums to find
                            connection and support through fun and engaging activities.
                            What we do at Keeping Mum is my
                            absolute passion and I am so excited for you to join us on this journey!</p>
